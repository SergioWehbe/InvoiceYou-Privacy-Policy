    <section>
      <h2>Effective Date</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2&nbsp;August&nbsp;2025.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>This application (“InvoiceYou”) is developed and operated by <strong>Sergio&nbsp;Wehbe</strong>, Lebanon, Mount&nbsp;Lebanon, Al&nbsp;Hadath (“I”, “me”, “my”). For any privacy‑related questions please e‑mail <a href="mailto:hello@sergiowehbe.com">hello@sergiowehbe.com</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Data I Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>None.</strong> The current version of InvoiceYou runs entirely on your device. It does not capture, store, or transmit personal data, images, analytics, or diagnostics outside the app sandbox.</p>
      <h3>In‑App Purchases</h3>
      <p>If you choose to subscribe, payment is processed by Apple. I do not receive your name, e‑mail address, or payment details—only a non‑identifying cryptographic receipt that tells the app whether your subscription is active.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Your Data Is Processed</h2>
      <p>All functionality—including any invoice parsing or validation—occurs locally on your device. No servers are involved and nothing is uploaded or shared.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>Because no personal data is collected, nothing is retained on my side. Any documents or settings you create stay on your device inside the app’s sandbox. Deleting the app will permanently remove them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>All app data is stored inside the secure iOS file system, which is encrypted at rest and protected by your device passcode or Face&nbsp;ID/Touch&nbsp;ID.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>InvoiceYou does not transmit any personal data off your device, so no international data transfers take place.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>InvoiceYou is not directed to children under 13. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Because InvoiceYou does not collect or store personal data, the rights of access, rectification, erasure, portability, restriction, and objection under the EU&nbsp;GDPR do not apply. If you have concerns, contact me using the details above.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the app and at this URL. Changes become effective immediately upon publication.</p>
